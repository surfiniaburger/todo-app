# todo-app
***********INTRODUCTION*************
A todo app is a simple yet powerful tool that helps individuals and teams stay organized and manage their tasks effectively. 
Here are some common applications and features of a todo app:

Task Management: A todo app allows users to create, organize, and manage their tasks in a structured manner. 
Users can create new tasks, set due dates, add descriptions, assign priorities, and categorize tasks into different lists or projects.

Reminder System: Todo apps often come with a reminder system that notifies users about upcoming or overdue tasks. 
Reminders can be set for specific dates and times to ensure that tasks are completed on time.

Task Prioritization: Todo apps enable users to prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency. 
This helps users focus on the most critical tasks and ensures that nothing important gets overlooked.

Task Scheduling: Users can schedule tasks by assigning specific dates and times for their completion. 
This feature allows for better time management and helps users allocate their resources effectively.

Task Collaboration: Some todo apps support collaboration features, allowing users to share tasks and collaborate with others. 
This is particularly useful for team projects or when tasks need to be delegated among team members.

Progress Tracking: Todo apps often provide features to track the progress of tasks. 
Users can mark tasks as complete, track the time spent on each task, and visualize their overall progress towards completing their tasks or goals.

Note Taking: In addition to basic task management, some todo apps offer note-taking capabilities. 
Users can attach additional notes, comments, or relevant files to tasks, providing a centralized location for all related information.

Cross-Platform Access: Many todo apps are available across multiple platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop. 
This ensures that users can access and manage their tasks seamlessly from their preferred devices.

Integration with Other Tools: Todo apps often integrate with other productivity tools, such as calendars, project management platforms, or team communication tools. 
These integrations allow for seamless workflow management and synchronization across different applications.

Data Synchronization: Todo apps that offer cloud storage or synchronization capabilities ensure that users' tasks and data are backed up and accessible from multiple devices. 
This enables users to stay updated and synchronized regardless of the device they are using.

Overall, a todo app provides a structured approach to task management, helping individuals and teams stay organized, prioritize their work, and increase productivity by efficiently managing their tasks and commitments.



*********INSTALLATION************

To run the provided code, you need to follow these steps:

Install Node.js: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

Set up the project:

a. Create a new directory for your project.

b. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Initialize the project: Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project and create a package.json file:

csharp
Copy code
      `npm init -y`
Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the required dependencies (Express, body-parser, MongoDB driver, Mongoose):

css
Copy code
 `npm install express body-parser mongodb mongoose ejs`
Create the models directory: Inside your project directory, create a new directory called models.

Create a file named todo.js inside the models directory and add the following code:

javascript
Copy code
`const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const todoSchema = new Schema({
  todo: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
});

todoSchema.statics.findTodos = function () {
  return this.find().exec();
};

const Todo = mongoose.model('Todo', todoSchema);
module.exports = Todo;`

Create a file named index.ejs in the root of your project and add your desired HTML/EJS code for the view.

Copy the provided code and save it in a file, such as app.js, in the root of your project.

Replace the MongoDB connection URI (dbURI) in the code with your own MongoDB database connection string. You can create a free MongoDB Atlas account and obtain the connection URI from there.

Start the server: Run the following command to start the server:

Copy code
node app.js
You should see the message "Server is running on port 3000" in the console, indicating that the server is running successfully.

Access the app: Open a web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the todo app.
That's it! You should now be able to use the todo app and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on your todos.
